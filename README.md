# Post-Office-Simulation-C-Code
This is a simple repository to organize all the files related to my Post Office Simulation. This project is written in the C++ Programming Language.

SIMULATION DESCRIPTION: This program simulates the line at the post office. Customers are able to enter the post office at any time during the 480 minute day. They arrive at intervals of 1 to 5 minutes and each customer has a task to handle with the postal employee. The task time can take between 1 and 4 minutes. With only one employee working, if the employee is helping another customer, all entering customers will be placed in line and helped in the order in which they arrived. This simple concept is illustrated using a queue to hold the time at which each customer arrives and a simple state machine to flag the status of the employee as either busy or available. All of this is contained in a while loop that runs for 480 iterations to simulate the length of a business day. If there is anyone left in the queue at the end of the 480 iterations, they are simply de-queued until the queue is empty. This program may also use an additional C++ file to hold all of the functions associated with the main method. Things to display at the closing of the doors would be total number of people processed, longest wait time, shortest wait time, average wait time, average task time, and how many customers are left at the door.
